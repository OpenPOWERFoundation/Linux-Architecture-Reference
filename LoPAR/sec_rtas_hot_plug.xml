  <title>Hot Plug Events</title>

  <para>Hot Plug Events, when implemented, are reported through
  either the event-scan RTAS call or a hotplug interrupt.</para>

  <para>An OS that wants to be notified of hotplug events will need to
  set the appropriate arch-vector bit.  Look for the hot-plug-events
  node in the /event-sources node of the OF device tree (see
  <xref linkend="sec_papr_bindings_hot_plug_events" />), enable the interrupts listed
  in its “interrupts” property and provide an interrupt handler to call
  check-exception when one of those interrupts are received.</para>

  <para>When a hotplug event occurs, whether reported by check-exception
  or event-scan, RTAS will directly pass back the Hotplug Event Log as
  described in <xref linkend="table.error.hotplug" />.</para>
