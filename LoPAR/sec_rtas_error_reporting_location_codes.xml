  <title>Location Codes</title>

  <para>This document defines an architecture extension for physical
  location codes. One use of location codes is to append failing location
  information to error logs returned by the
  <emphasis>event-scan</emphasis> and
  <emphasis>check-exception</emphasis> RTAS services. Refer to
  <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50569341_35066"/> for more information on the
  format and use of location codes. For event logs with Version 6 or later,
  the location code of FRU call out is contained in the Primary SRC
  section, FRU call out sub-section of the Platform Event Log
  format.</para>
