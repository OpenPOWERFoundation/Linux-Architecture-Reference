  <title>Terms</title>

    <para>This standard uses technical terms as they are defined in the
    IEEE Std 1275-1994 Standard and other
    documents cited in &#8220;References&#8221;, plus the following
    terms:</para>

            Configuration) Firmware, Core Practices and Requirements</para>

        <term><emphasis role="bold">effective address</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The 64- or 32-bit address computed by the processor
            when executing a Storage Access or Branch instruction, or when fetching the
            next sequential instruction. If address translation is disabled, the real
            address is the same as the effective address. If address translation is
            enabled, the real address is determined by, but not necessarily identical
            to, the effective address.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>An area within the stack that is reserved for saving
            certain registers across procedure calls in PA run-time models. This area
            is reserved by the caller and is allocated above the current stack pointer

          <listitem>
            <para>A data structure used by some PA run-time models
            to represent a C &#8220;pointer to procedure&#8221;. The first word of this

        <term><emphasis role="bold">real-mode</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The mode in which OF and its client are running with
            translation disabled; all addresses passed between the client and OF are
            real (i.e., hardware) addresses.</para>

        <term><emphasis role="bold">segmented address translation</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The process whereby an Effective Address (EA) is translated into a
            Virtual Address (VA) and the virtual address is translated into a Real
            Address (RA). (see
            <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50569374_41703" />and Book III of
            <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50569387_99718" />for more detail.)</para>

        <term><emphasis role="bold">suspend</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>A form of Power Management characterized by a fast recovery

          <listitem>
            <para>A data structure used by some PA run-time models that is used for
            access to global variables and for inter-module linkage. When a TOC is
            used,
            <emphasis>%r2</emphasis> contains its base address.</para>
          </listitem>
		  </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="bold">Virtual Address</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>In IEEE 1275 parlance, the address that a program uses to access
            a memory location or
            memory-mapped device register. Depending on the presence or absence of
            memory mapping hardware in the system, and whether or not that mapping
            hardware is enabled, a virtual address may or may not be the same as the
            physical (real) address that appears on an external bus. The IEEE 1275
            definition of &#8220;virtual address&#8221; corresponds to The PA's
            definition of &#8220;effective address.&#8221; Except as noted, this
            document uses the IEEE 1275 definition of virtual address.</para>

            <para>In PA parlance, an internal address within the PA address
            translation mechanism, used
            as in intermediate term in the translation of an effective address to the
            corresponding real address.</para>

        <term><emphasis role="bold">virtual-mode</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The mode in which OF and its client share a single
            virtual address space, and address translation is enabled; all addresses
            passed between the client and OF are virtual (translated) addresses.</para>
