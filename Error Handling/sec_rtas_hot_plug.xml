  <para>Hot Plug Events, when implemented, are reported through the
  event-scan RTAS call. These events are surfaced through the fixed
  portions of the RTAS return value. (see 
  <xref linkend="dbdoclet.50569337_21249"/>) Some parts of the system may
  be modified without direct support from the OS.</para>
